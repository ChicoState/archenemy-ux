# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Following our successful Phase II refinement of wireframes, our UX team has now advanced to creating and evaluating a high-fidelity prototype of Archenemy. The primary objective of this phase was to conduct usability testing with actual users to validate the interface design, identify usability issues, and gather insights for further refinement before implementation. Our usability testing aimed to ensure that users can navigate through the core functions of account creation, matchmaking, communication, and profile management with ease and satisfaction. This report details our methodology, findings, and recommendations derived from these evaluations.

## Methods

For our usability evaluation, we employed a formative evaluation approach combined with a think-aloud protocol. This approach was selected to gain insights into users' thought processes, experiences, and pain points while interacting with our prototype. The formative nature of the evaluation allowed us to identify usability issues early in the development process, making it possible to refine the design before implementation.

The think-aloud protocol required participants to verbalize their thoughts, reactions, and decision-making processes while completing tasks. This provided valuable qualitative data about their mental models, expectations, and areas of confusion.

We recruited 6 participants for our usability study. The participants had varied backgrounds and experiences with matching apps, which provided diverse perspectives on our design. The recruitment diversity included:

1. College students >18
2. Mix of genders
3. Varied experience with matching apps
4. Some interest in competitive activities

The usability tests were conducted using our Figma prototype (high-fidelity) with a standardized protocol and script for consistency; the participants' responses were written into our data collection spreadsheet.

We designed five tasks to evaluate different aspects of the user experience:

### Task 1: Account Creation

Participants were instructed to create a new account for themselves.
This task evaluated the learnability and efficiency of the registration process, with all required fields found on the Register and Create Account pages.

Research questions: Is the account creation process intuitive? Are the required fields clear? Can users complete registration without assistance?

### Task 2: Finding and Chatting with an Archenemy

Participants were asked to find an archenemy and start a chat to express their hatred.
This task evaluated the core matchmaking functionality of the app, found on the Home page.

Research questions: Is the process of finding and connecting with archenemies intuitive? Is the messaging interface easy to use? Do users understand the "yes/no" archenemy selection mechanism?

### Task 3: Password Reset

Participants were instructed to reset their account password.
This task evaluated the findability and usability of our **Reset Password** button in the Settings page.

Research questions: Can users locate the password reset function? Is the reset process straightforward and efficient?

### Task 4: Finding FAQ/Help Information

Participants were asked to access the FAQ for more information.
This task evaluated information architecture and navigation, notably the **HELP** button on the Settings page.

Research questions: Can users easily find help when needed? Is the help content organized in an intuitive location?

### Task 5: Edit Account Information

Participants were instructed to edit their account and update information.
This task evaluated the profile management functionality on the Account page.

Research questions: Is the profile editing process intuitive? Can users easily update their information?

For each task, we collected both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative measures included task completion rates (success/failure), ease of use ratings on a 5-point scale (1=Very Difficult, 5=Very Easy), and the likelihood to use the app in real life (1-5 scale). Qualitative measures were verbal think-aloud comments during task completion, observations of user behavior and navigation paths, and feedback during post-test debriefing.

### Quantitative Results (graph above)

Our usability testing yielded strong quantitative results across all tasks. All participants (100%) successfully completed each of the five tasks, demonstrating that the core functionality of the Archenemy app is navigable and usable, albeit with varying degrees of ease. Our spreadsheet can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wkU67Ii0XeaUfzzLd5b22Wcr9DBEqPfqJ_evFl1MAww/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

#### Task Completion and Ease of Use

The following chart summarizes the task completion rates and average ease of use ratings for each task:

| Task | Description | Completion Rate | Ease of Use (1-5) |
|------|-------------|----------------|------------------|
| Task 1 | Account Creation | 100% | 5.0 |
| Task 2 | Finding & Chatting | 100% | 4.3 |
| Task 3 | Password Reset | 100% | 3.8 |
| Task 4 | Finding FAQ/Help | 100% | 4.0 |
| Task 5 | Edit Account | 100% | 5.0 |

Task 1 (Account Creation) and Task 5 (Edit Account) received the highest ease ratings (5.0), indicating these features are highly intuitive. Task 3 (Password Reset) received the lowest ease rating (3.8), suggesting potential room for improvement in the findability or process of this feature.

#### Likelihood to Use

When asked about their likelihood to use the Archenemy app in real life, participants gave an average rating of 2.8 on a 5-point scale. This moderate rating suggests that while the app is functional and novel, there may be concerns about its practical utility or appeal in real-world contexts.

### Qualitative Results

Qualitative data from the think-aloud protocol and debriefing sessions revealed several important insights about the user experience:

#### Task 1: Account Creation
- Users found the registration process straightforward and intuitive
- Some confusion about what the "subtitle" field represented
- Some users attempted to click on images to select profile pictures

#### Task 2: Finding and Chatting with an Archenemy
- Users expected more feedback after clicking "Yes" to confirm a match
- Some confusion about the meaning of "Yes" and "No" buttons (vs. traditional swiping)
- Users wanted clearer indication of who sent which messages in the chat
- Need for notifications when new matches occur

#### Task 3: Password Reset
- Users had difficulty locating the reset password function
- Several users looked for it in the Account section before finding it in Settings
- Suggestions to move this functionality to the Account tab for better findability

#### Task 4: Finding FAQ/Help
- Users had significant difficulty locating the FAQ/Help section
- Several navigation paths were attempted before finding it in Settings
- Confusion about the difference between "Help" and "FAQ"
- Suggestions that Help should be more prominently displayed in navigation

#### Task 5: Edit Account Information
- Users found account editing straightforward and easy
- Suggestions for real-time preview of profile changes
- Clear and intuitive field editing

### Background Context

Our background questions revealed that half of our participants had no prior experience with matching apps. Those who did mentioned features they valued:
- Swiping mechanisms
- Chat functionality
- Location-based matching
- Profile customization

Common frustrations with existing apps included:
- Ghosting
- Repetitive interactions
- Limited filtering options for non-binary users

All participants engaged in some form of competitive activities, most commonly:
- Video games
- Sports
- Friendly competitions with friends

Motivations for competition primarily centered around:
- Desire to win
- Improvement of skills
- Ranking systems

### Overall Impressions

- "Cool app if [you] want to 'brawl'"

Most valued features included:
- The main matchmaking functionality
- Chat pages
- The overall concept of finding rivals

Most confusing aspects included:
- Navigation issues
- Location of help/FAQ
- Lack of system feedback for actions
- Unclear meaning of Yes/No buttons versus swiping
