# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Following our successful Phase II refinement of wireframes, our UX team has now advanced to creating and evaluating a high-fidelity prototype of Archenemy. The primary objective of this phase was to conduct usability testing with actual users to validate the interface design, identify usability issues, and gather insights for further refinement before implementation. Our usability testing aimed to ensure that users can navigate through the core functions of account creation, matchmaking, communication, and profile management with ease and satisfaction. This report details our methodology, findings, and recommendations derived from these evaluations.

## Methods

For our usability evaluation, we employed a formative evaluation approach combined with a think-aloud protocol. This approach was selected to gain insights into users' thought processes, experiences, and pain points while interacting with our prototype. The formative nature of the evaluation allowed us to identify usability issues early in the development process, making it possible to refine the design before implementation.

The think-aloud protocol required participants to verbalize their thoughts, reactions, and decision-making processes while completing tasks. This provided valuable qualitative data about their mental models, expectations, and areas of confusion.

We recruited 6 participants for our usability study. The participants had varied backgrounds and experiences with matching apps, which provided diverse perspectives on our design. The recruitment diversity included:

1. College students >18
2. Mix of genders
3. Varied experience with matching apps
4. Some interest in competitive activities

The usability tests were conducted using our Figma prototype (high-fidelity) with a standardized protocol and script for consistency; the participants' responses were written into our data collection spreadsheet.

We designed five tasks to evaluate different aspects of the user experience:

### Task 1: Account Creation

Participants were instructed to create a new account for themselves.
This task evaluated the learnability and efficiency of the registration process.

Research questions: Is the account creation process intuitive? Are the required fields clear? Can users complete registration without assistance?

### Task 2: Finding and Chatting with an Archenemy

Participants were asked to find an archenemy and start a chat to express their hatred.
This task evaluated the core matchmaking functionality of the app.

Research questions: Is the process of finding and connecting with archenemies intuitive? Is the messaging interface easy to use? Do users understand the "yes/no" archenemy selection mechanism?

### Task 3: Password Reset

Participants were instructed to reset their account password.
This task evaluated the findability and usability of account recovery features.

Research questions: Can users locate the password reset function? Is the reset process straightforward and efficient?

### Task 4: Finding FAQ/Help Information

Participants were asked to access the FAQ for more information.
This task evaluated information architecture and navigation.

Research questions: Can users easily find help when needed? Is the help content organized in an intuitive location?

### Task 5: Edit Account Information

Participants were instructed to edit their account and update information.
This task evaluated the profile management functionality.

Research questions: Is the profile editing process intuitive? Can users easily update their information?

For each task, we collected both quantitative and qualitative data. Quantitative measures included task completion rates (success/failure), ease of use ratings on a 5-point scale (1=Very Difficult, 5=Very Easy), and the likelihood to use the app in real life (1-5 scale). Qualitative measures were verbal think-aloud comments during task completion, observations of user behavior and navigation paths, and feedback during post-test debriefing.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
