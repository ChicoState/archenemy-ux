# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

Following our successful Phase II refinement of wireframes, our UX team has now advanced to creating and evaluating a high-fidelity prototype of Archenemy. The primary objective of this phase was to conduct usability testing with actual users to validate the interface design, identify usability issues, and gather insights for further refinement before implementation. Our usability testing aimed to ensure that users can navigate through the core functions of account creation, matchmaking, communication, and profile management with ease and satisfaction. This report details our methodology, findings, and recommendations derived from these evaluations.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. Only include research methods in here, not design documents/techniques/artifacts !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
