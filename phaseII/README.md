# Phase II: Refining Interaction and Designing Wireframes

## Introduction

Following our successful Phase I research and analysis, our UX team has now focused on translating our initial conclusions into refined design artifacts. During this phase, we concentrated on validating and enhancing our wireframes through cognitive walkthroughs and sought informal feedback to ensure our design meets user expectations. Our primary objective was to validate the matchmaking functionality, the core feature of Archenemy, while identifying areas for potential improvement in the overall user experience. This phase of work focused on ensuring that our design properly facilitates Archenemy's unique form of connection and engagement.

## Methods

### Cognitive Walkthrough

We employed cognitive walkthroughs to evaluate our wireframe designs from a user perspective systematically. This method involves stepping through the interface as a specific user would, performing tasks related to their goals while answering predefined questions about the experience at each step.

One external UX evaluator (Numan Khan) performed a cognitive walkthrough using the "Elong Mask" persona in the "Basement" scenario. For each step in the interaction, the evaluator answered the following questions:

1. Will the user know what to do at this step?
2. If the user does the right action, will they know they did the right thing and are making progress toward their goal?
3. Can the user actually perform the action (physically, cognitively)?

This methodology allowed us to identify potential usability issues before implementation and validate whether users could successfully accomplish their goals with our current design.

### Informal Peer Feedback

Our methodology included gathering informal feedback through a demonstration presented by our Software Engineering team partners. We provided the question "What are the most impactful characteristics of a person that could make them your archenemy?" which was posed to a classroom of approximately 35 undergraduate software engineering students.

The purpose of this method was to gain insights into user perceptions of potential rival characteristics, which would inform our matchmaking algorithm design and interface presentation. However, as noted in our findings section, we experienced limitations with this feedback channel.

## Findings

### Cognitive Walkthrough

The cognitive walkthrough performed by Numan Khan from the perspective of the Elong Mask persona provided valuable insights into our matchmaking functionality:

1. The evaluator successfully accomplished the goal outlined in the "Basement" scenario, confirming that our primary user flow is functional and intuitive.
2. Each step in the process was found to be discrete, traceable, and linear, suggesting a clear path to goal completion.
3. The walkthrough validated that users can understand what actions to take at each step of the matchmaking process.
4. The linear progression through the app's matchmaking feature demonstrated that users can follow the intended flow without confusion.

The walkthrough primarily focused on the matchmaking functionality, which is the core feature of the Archenemy app. Secondary features and alternative flows were not evaluated in this process.

### Informal Peer Feedback

Despite our structured approach to gathering informal feedback, we encountered a significant limitation: our Software Engineering team has not yet provided us with the results from the classroom demonstration. The question about archenemy characteristics was posed to approximately 35 students, but the responses were not made available to the UX team for analysis.

This gap in our research represents a missed opportunity to incorporate diverse perspectives into our design refinement process. The absence of this feedback limits our ability to make data-driven decisions about certain aspects of the UI, especially those related to profile creation and matchmaking criteria.

## Conclusions

Based on our findings from the cognitive walkthrough, we have confirmed that our primary matchmaking functionality is well-designed and supports user goals effectively. The discrete, traceable, and linear steps observed in the walkthrough indicate that users should be able to navigate through the matchmaking process with minimal friction.

However, the limited scope of our evaluation (one persona, one scenario, and one evaluator) means that we have not comprehensively validated all aspects of the application. Secondary functionalities such as profile management, messaging, and competition tracking require additional testing to ensure they meet our usability standards.

The lack of informal peer feedback from the Software Engineering team represents a gap in our understanding of user preferences regarding archenemy characteristics. This information would have been valuable for refining our matching algorithm and interface.

Our wireframes have proven effective for the core functionality but may benefit from minor stylistic refinements to enhance visual clarity and emotional engagement. The competitive nature of the Archenemy app requires careful consideration of visual cues that encourage healthy rivalry rather than negative hostility.

### Design Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend the following:

1. Maintain the current flow for the matchmaking functionality, as it has been validated through the cognitive walkthrough.
2. Implement minor stylistic refinements to the wireframes to enhance visual clarity and emotional engagement.
3. Expand testing to cover secondary functionalities with multiple personas and scenarios.
4. Establish a more robust feedback mechanism with the Software Engineering team to ensure timely receipt of user insights.
5. Consider conducting additional research with participants from diverse backgrounds beyond software/tech to ensure the app appeals to a broader audience.

## Caveats

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings:

1. **Limited cognitive walkthrough participation**: Only one external UX evaluator performed a cognitive walkthrough, which limits the diversity of perspectives and may not uncover all potential usability issues. Ideally, we would have multiple evaluators testing different personas and scenarios.

2. **Absence of informal peer feedback**: The lack of feedback from the Software Engineering team's demonstration means we are missing potentially valuable insights from 35 undergraduate students, which could have informed our design decisions.

3. **Homogeneous feedback sources**: All current feedback comes from individuals with software/tech backgrounds, which may not be representative of our broader target audience. Archenemy is designed for a diverse user base, and feedback from non-technical users would provide a more comprehensive understanding of potential usability issues.

4. **Focus on primary functionality**: The cognitive walkthrough primarily evaluated the matchmaking feature, leaving secondary functionalities unexamined. A comprehensive evaluation would include all major features and user flows.

These limitations highlight the need for expanded research efforts in future phases to ensure our design meets the needs of all potential users and supports all intended functionalities.
