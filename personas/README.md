### PERSONA 1: Elong Mask

- A 53-year-old male (but claims to be "ageless, like a blockchain")  living in his mother’s basement (specifically, a luxury basement with LED strip lighting and a "No Karens Allowed" sign) in Boca Raton, Florida. She charges him rent in Dogecoin.
- Self-proclaimed "Chief Meme Officer" at DOGE, his failing startup that sells "innovative" products like:
  - Solar-powered flashlight (only works in direct sunlight).
  - Flammenwerfer 2.0 (a hairdryer duct-taped to a Bic lighter).
  - CyberTruck Bedazzler™ (a DIY kit to cover your car in rhinestones "for aerodynamic efficiency").
- Dropped out of Community College Mars Program (online course)
- Claims to have 11 children but refers to his Minecraft server as "the future of humanity" and believes he’s "saving the world" by reposting memes about crypto and arguing about sci-fi plot holes on Reddit.
- Elong wants to find a nemesis who "understands his genius" but is just successful enough to fuel his persecution complex. He will attempt to sabotage rivals by sending them poorly Photoshopped memes of their faces on SpongeBob characters.
- Swipes LEFT on anyone who:
  - Works a 9-to-5 job ("sheeple").
  - Has ever vacationed on Earth ("Mars or bust, losers")?
- Swipes RIGHT on anyone who:
  - Mentions NFTs, Rick and Morty, “Daddy Trump”, or free Bitcoin in their bio.
- Looks like they’d "accidentally" leak his DMs to BuzzFeed.
- Quote:
  - "I don’t need friends—I need arch-enemies to validate my self-worth. Also, pls buy my Flammenwerfer 2.0. Mom says I have 48 hours to make rent."
- Bio:
  - "Technoking of Dogecoin. Part-time supervillain. Full-time basement dweller. Let’s feud so I can screenshot your insults and tweet ‘#Checkmate’." [🚀🔥💎🙌 emojis x12]

### PERSONA 2: Richard Newspaper

- 24-yr-old male, living off campus and attending college
- He enjoys spending time out of the house and interacting with his friends/classmates. The mere possibility of hanging out and spending time with someone is enough to make the day enjoyable. He is a night owl, gaining energy as the moon rises. He is apt to ignore the schoolwork and responsibilities of the real world to live it up one more time, every time. His friends are his habits, and he lets his habits get in his own way sometimes. He is loyal, honest, and fair, with a supreme air of “goofy” always present.
- Goals
  - Finding a stable job with enough free time to see his friends
  - Interacting with interesting people and making new connections
  - Finding new and interesting ways to spend hours

### PERSONA 3: Hatera Ferrari

- A 40-year-old woman, divorced.
  - 2 children
  - Divorced after 6 years of marriage
- She lives in Rome, Italy.
- She works as a team manager at an IT company.
  - She likes her work, but she rarely gets invited to events. Many of her colleagues don’t do enough work, and she has to work overtime several days a week to accommodate it.
  - Even on her weekends, she often has to work unpaid.
  - She secretly hates some of her coworkers, especially the ones who don’t do a lot of work and are not responsible.
- Hatera drives to work early (6:50 am) and comes back late (7:20-7:46 pm).
- Doesn’t have many friends and meets them in person very rarely.
- Wants to get a promotion, but doesn’t want to change jobs because of her family, and any possible instability.
- Goals
  - Hatera wants to vent her work frustrations but has to maintain her “good team manager” image.
  - Hatera wants to find new connections, but doesn’t have time to develop deep bond with those people (and for some reason everyone ghosts her after some time).
- Quote
  - “Uh, some of my coworkers are just slacking around and expect me to get their work done for THEM. And if something doesn’t get done, it’s MY fault as a team manager!”
- Bio
  - “Best team manager in the company🏢.  Mother of 2. As soon as I get the promotion, most of my team are getting a demotion😈.“

# Scenarios

### Scenario 1: At home with Elong Mask
- It’s a normal day at home, Elong’s mother is upstairs doing whatever it is that rational adults do, probably taxes or talking with friends. It’s midday, the sun is shining horribly in through the cracked windows at the top of the basement. The faint smell of rot and refuse permeates the room, filling any newcomer’s nose with a putrid flavor of data-mining and dank memes.
- The boredom is building. Elong’s normal array of shitposts and rage-bait just isn’t hitting the spot anymore. He calls out to his mother for some company, but all he can muster to say is how much he needs a new 24 pack of Mountain Dew Doritos. Dismayed, he turns once again to his phone, encased in solid black and adorned with stickers of a fedora and various sharp instruments. There is a new ad on his favorite reddit page, r/okbuddygenshin/ : “Do you know what your Archenemy is saying about you?”

### Scenario 2: Richard is bored during finals week
- It's finals week. He was going to hang out, but his pal bailed. And all other Richard’s friends are busy studying for finals. Since Richard chose the easiest classes he could, he really has no need to study much. It is cold outside, so Richard decides to waste a few hours before going to lunch.
- Lately, Richard was looking for a job, but all companies seemingly just ignore his applications. And then there are bums who brag all day about how they snatched a job at Nasa, Department of Education, or whatever else they have. Annoyed to no end, he tweets about it, but his post is not received too well. And then Richard sees a comment “Imagine not having an Archenemy and needing to complain on Twitter about this XD”.

### Scenario 3: Hatera is hungry for virtual vengeance
- It’s 9:30 PM on a Thursday, and Hatera just closed her laptop after another 14-hour workday. Her team missed a critical deadline, simply because two coworkers claimed their “Wi-Fi crashed” (she knows they were binge-watching Love Island). She pours a glass of cheap Chianti, collapses onto her IKEA couch (still unassembled from 2018), and opens Instagram. But she hesitates: posting a vague rant about “professional incompetence” would ruin her polished “team player” facade. Hatera’s fingers itch; she needs to vent, but her real-life options are bleak. Her college friends stopped replying after she canceled three brunches in a row. Her ex-husband would just say, “Should’ve married Paolo like your mom said.” Even her cat, Garfield, judges her (he’s team “sleep instead”). She thinks about that app her coworkers have been talking about: Archenemy—not for friends, but for strategic catharsis. Maybe she’s about to swipe right on a smug tech bro in Milan who brags about “delegating 90% of my work while my boss thinks I’m a genius”, maybe not. One way to find out…
