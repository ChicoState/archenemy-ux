# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Archenemy is tackling a unique yet underserved problem in the global community—helping professionals find their ultimate rival to push their skills to the next level. Just as competition drives innovation, having a nemesis can foster growth, motivation, and a deeper engagement with one's craft. In this first phase, our UX team has focused on laying a strong foundation for an intuitive and compelling user experience. We developed detailed personas and scenarios to ensure our design decisions align with real user needs, conducted heuristic evaluations to identify potential usability issues early, and created individual UI sketches—from which we will ultimately synthesize the best elements into a cohesive, group-designed interface. This phase has set the stage for a frictionless, engaging, and purpose-driven user journey.

## Methods

!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. Only include research methods in here, not design documents/techniques/artifacts !!!

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
