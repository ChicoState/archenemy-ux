# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Archenemy is tackling a unique yet underserved problem in the global community—helping professionals find their ultimate rival to push their skills to the next level. Just as competition drives innovation, having a nemesis can foster growth, motivation, and a deeper engagement with one's craft. In this first phase, our UX team has focused on laying a strong foundation for an intuitive and compelling user experience. We developed detailed personas and scenarios to ensure our design decisions align with real user needs, conducted heuristic evaluations to identify potential usability issues early, and created individual UI sketches—from which we will ultimately synthesize the best elements into a cohesive, group-designed interface. This phase has set the stage for a frictionless, engaging, and purpose-driven user journey.

## Methods

Our team of UX designers (n = 3) used three different research methods so far: Competitive Analysis, Personas/Scenarios, and a Competitive Heuristic Evaluation. For the competitive analysis, we searched the web for products near our app's current market and arranged a list of our top competitors. As the search continued, we started to come across companies that are similar to ours in flavor, but not necessarily direct competitors. We did this to understand how much of the market is already tapped, and whether or not we have any scape to capture. For the Personas/Scenarios, we had all three of our designers come up with a persona that would use the app. Afterwards, we had all three designers create a scenario for a different persona than the one they designed. As for the competitive analysis, we took a deep dive into our top competitor; Tinder.

## Findings

The team came up with many useful insights from the research. From the competitive analysis, we discovered that there is a highly untapped market for our app's particular set of users. There is no other company that attempts to do what we are doing. From the personas/scenarios, we came to the conclusion that our users must have a strong reason to open the app. This idea boils down understanding that we need to convince users that there is a void in their life that only our app can fill, and that we are faithfully filling it. From the heuristic evaluation, we determined that Tinder is the #1 dating app on mobile for a very good reason. They scored very highly on almost all of the heuristics (Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design), from which we determined that they can be a very useful source of design ideas and business decisions to further our apps potency.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
